# ⚙️ Linux Commands Covered

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `top` | Real-time system monitoring |
| `htop` | Interactive process viewer |
| `ps` | Display running processes |
| `vmstat` | System performance statistics |
| `free` | Check memory usage |
| `df` | Filesystem disk usage |
| `du` | Directory disk usage |
| `nice` | Start process with priority |
| `renice` | Change process priority |
| `kill` | Terminate process using PID |
| `pkill` | Kill process by name |

---

# 🧪 Hands-On Lab Workflow

## 1️⃣ Connect to AWS EC2

```bash
ssh -i "linux-key.pem" ec2-user@18.216.66.3
```

---

## 2️⃣ Switch to Root User

```bash
sudo su -
```

---

## 3️⃣ Generate CPU Load

```bash
yes > /dev/null &
```

This command creates artificial CPU load for troubleshooting practice.

---

## 4️⃣ Monitor Running Processes

```bash
top
```

### Useful `top` Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Shift + P` | Sort by CPU usage |
| `Shift + M` | Sort by memory usage |
| `k` | Kill process |
| `r` | Change nice value |
| `q` | Exit top |

---

## 5️⃣ Find Specific Process

```bash
ps aux | grep yes
```

---

## 6️⃣ Change Process Priority

```bash
renice -n 10 -p <PID>
```

### Nice Value Priority Range

| Nice Value | Priority |
|---|---|
| `-20` | Highest Priority |
| `0` | Default Priority |
| `19` | Lowest Priority |

---

## 7️⃣ Monitor System Performance

```bash
vmstat 1
```

### Important vmstat Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `r` | Running processes |
| `free` | Free memory |
| `si` | Swap in |
| `so` | Swap out |
| `wa` | I/O wait |
| `id` | CPU idle |

---

## 8️⃣ Check Memory Usage

```bash
free -h
```

---

## 9️⃣ Check Disk Usage

```bash
df -h
```

---

## 🔟 Create Disk Usage for Testing

```bash
mkdir disk-test
```

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk-test/file1.img bs=100M count=5
```

This creates a 500MB file for disk troubleshooting practice.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Find Large Files & Directories

```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Kill High CPU Process

```bash
pkill yes
```

OR

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

---

# 📊 DevOps Troubleshooting Workflow

```text
Server Performance Issue
          ↓
Check CPU Usage → top / htop
          ↓
Find Problematic Process → ps
          ↓
Analyze Memory → free / vmstat
          ↓
Check Disk Space → df
          ↓
Find Large Files → du
          ↓
Optimize / Kill Process
```

# Cleanup Script

A simple Bash cleanup script was created to:
- stop CPU load generation processes
- remove temporary test files
- clean the troubleshooting environment

Location:

```bash
scripts/cleanup.sh
```
